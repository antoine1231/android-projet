Project
This project provides information about cars, their model and attributes, through various brands, types and regions of the world.

Our dataset was imported from: 
https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/data/cars.csv
It was later adapted to json format, before being incorporated within our API


API
The endpoint of our API is in the project "Project_MDR-AMO"

In our API, all of the following parts are modeled:

⤵️ GET routes to get information such as all cars or one model precisely 
⭐️ Option to put a car model in favorite via a PUT route
🔎 This code has been simplified as much as possible to be appealing
📝  This code has been commented to make it easy to read
☁️ It has been deployed to the cloud. Our app is now up and running with all its’ components

ANDROID PART

Our app has been created to take advantage and enhance our API, making it a real Android application, usable on a smartphone.

Features of the app:

🏛 The global architecture of the app is complete, up and running
🧩 Our buttons set up our fragments
🗾 A map method has been implemented to display the position of the models in the world
📝A list method has been implemented to display the list of the models, the user can click to see the details
☁️The whole backend has been implemented but is not connected to the application
ℹ️ The information method of the app displays the expected output to the user
